# PyLingo - Python Learning Platform

PyLingo is a Duolingo-style platform for learning Python, with everything from very basic getting started all the way to AI mastery and different tracks like data engineering, algorithms, and more.

## Current Working Directory
**Primary Development Directory**: `/Users/wlee/Wayne/personal-projects/pylingo/pylingo-clean`

## Project Status & Features

### Implemented Learning Tracks
- **Beginner**: Basic Python concepts (variables, strings, lists, loops)
- **Intermediate**: Advanced concepts (dictionaries, conditionals, list comprehensions, error handling)
- **Advanced**: Object-oriented programming, file operations, complex error handling
- **Data Science**: NumPy, Pandas, data analysis, visualization with matplotlib/seaborn
- **AI/ML**: Complete ML pipeline from PyTorch basics to Transformers and LLMs
- **Web Development**: Flask APIs, databases, HTTP requests
- **Data Processing**: CSV processing, file handling, statistics
- **Algorithms**: LeetCode-style coding challenges with comprehensive test execution

### Recent Developments
- **LeetCode-Style Challenge System**: Implemented comprehensive coding challenges with:
  - Multiple test cases (visible and hidden)
  - Time and memory limits
  - Detailed examples and constraints
  - Interactive code execution and validation
- **Advanced AI/ML Curriculum**: Complete track from PyTorch tensors to building GPT models
- **Monaco Editor Integration**: Professional code editing experience
- **Comprehensive Test Runner**: Automated test execution for coding challenges

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Monaco Editor for code editing
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python, comprehensive lesson management
- **Code Execution**: Docker-based execution service for running Python code
- **Database**: Lesson data with detailed metadata, validation rules, and test cases

### Current Implementation Status
The platform includes:
1. **Track Selector**: Displays available learning paths with icons and descriptions
2. **Lesson System**: Interactive lessons with code execution and validation
3. **Challenge System**: LeetCode-style problems with automated testing
4. **Progress Tracking**: User progress through different tracks and difficulties
5. **Code Editor**: Monaco-based editor with Python syntax highlighting

### Development Notes
- **Algorithms Track**: Successfully implemented with coding challenges (Two Sum, Reverse String, Valid Parentheses)
- **AI/ML Track**: Extensive curriculum covering PyTorch, NLP, Transformers, and LLM training
- **Challenge Execution**: Comprehensive test case validation with hidden test cases
- **React Compliance**: All React Hooks Rules violations have been resolved

# Important Instruction Reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
