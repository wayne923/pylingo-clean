# PyLingo Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-31 04:28:19
**Current State:** Enhanced skill tree deployed with TypeScript fixes

## Recent Progress Summary

### Last Action: Researched PyLingo current state and identified next high-impact improvements
**Outcome:** Comprehensive analysis shows strong technical foundation but missing key Duolingo-style engagement features like gamification, streaks, and social elements
**Next Reason:** Implement Duolingo-style gamification system starting with daily streak counter and XP point system as highest impact improvements

### Current Priority
Implement D3-style interactive knowledge graph for skill tree visualization

## Architecture Status
Frontend on Netlify, Backend on Railway, Both operational

## Deployment Status
- **Frontend:** https://gleeful-concha-992e6b.netlify.app
- **Backend:** https://pylingo-clean-production.up.railway.app  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on Railway

## Feature Status
- **Authentication:** ✅ working
- **Skill Tree:** ⏸️ enhanced version deployed
- **Lesson System:** ⏸️ functional with tracks
- **Code Execution:** ⏸️ docker-based working
- **Challenge System:** ⏸️ leetcode-style implemented

## Learning Tracks
beginner, intermediate, advanced, data-science, ai-ml, web-development, algorithms

## Recent Actions History

### 1. Researched PyLingo current state and identified next high-impact improvements
**When:** 2025-07-31 04:28:19
**Outcome:** Comprehensive analysis shows strong technical foundation but missing key Duolingo-style engagement features like gamification, streaks, and social elements
**Next Reason:** Implement Duolingo-style gamification system starting with daily streak counter and XP point system as highest impact improvements
- **Issues Found:**
  - Platform needs gamification and engagement systems to compete with Duolingo
  - strong content foundation exists

### 2. Implemented interactive knowledge graph features for skill tree
**When:** 2025-07-31 04:14:14
**Outcome:** Successfully added dynamic prerequisite visualization, advanced node interactions, and D3-level interactivity without complex force simulation
**Next Reason:** Deploy interactive features and evaluate knowledge graph visualization effectiveness

### 3. Attempted D3 force-directed graph implementation
**When:** 2025-07-31 04:11:35
**Outcome:** Encountered TypeScript syntax errors during complex D3 integration, reverted to stable state for incremental approach
**Next Reason:** Implement simpler D3 interactive features incrementally starting with enhanced node interactions and prerequisite visualization
- **Issues Found:**
  - Complex D3 integration caused syntax errors
  - need incremental implementation approach

### 4. Completed comprehensive mobile responsiveness optimization
**When:** 2025-07-31 03:55:00
**Outcome:** Mobile view mode deployed with touch support, performance optimizations, and auto-detection working
**Next Reason:** Enhance skill tree with D3-level interactive knowledge graph capabilities and advanced node-based interactions
- **Issues Found:**
  - Current implementation could be more interactive and knowledge-graph-like

### 5. Implemented mobile-specific view mode for enhanced skill tree
**When:** 2025-07-31 03:50:12
**Outcome:** Created auto-detecting mobile view with linear layout, node prioritization, and performance optimizations
**Next Reason:** Deploy mobile view mode and evaluate overall mobile responsiveness improvements achieved

## Key Commands
```bash
# Development
cd frontend && npm start              # Start frontend dev server
cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload  # Start backend dev server

# Deployment
git push origin main                  # Auto-deploy to Netlify/Railway

# Memory Updates
python update_memory.py "action" "outcome" "next_reason" "issue1,issue2"
```

## Context for AI Assistants
This is a Duolingo-style Python learning platform with:
- React/TypeScript frontend deployed on Netlify
- FastAPI backend deployed on Railway  
- PostgreSQL database
- Docker-based code execution
- Multiple learning tracks from beginner to AI/ML
- LeetCode-style coding challenges

**Where we left off:** Implement Duolingo-style gamification system starting with daily streak counter and XP point system as highest impact improvements
